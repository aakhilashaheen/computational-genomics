The answers folders contains all the plots and the outputs.
The default run requires passing of the file to main and this generates all the outputs including the ones for 
the bonus part.


Explantion for bonus:
I've used my code to create the newick files and generated the tree visualisation using an online tool.
reg4 is most similar to the whole-16S tree as expected because this is the region with the highest conservation amongst the variable regions and it is also longer than the others. 
Specifically comparing it to reg1, reg4 is longer and has better conservation.
